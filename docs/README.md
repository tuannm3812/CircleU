## Folder Map

- `product/`: what the app is, who it serves, and how the user flow works.
- `engineering/`: architecture, source ownership, domain language, backend boundaries, and technical decisions.
- `qa/`: repeatable manual checks for simulator and real-phone testing.
- `process/`: Git workflow, commit standards, branch rules, and collaboration norms.
- `archive/`: historical plans and specs. Archived files are reference material, not current instructions.

## Documentation Standard

Keep active docs short, current, and action-oriented. A current doc should answer what the team should do now; historical implementation notes belong in `archive/`.

When behavior, architecture, or process changes, update the matching active doc in the same commit. If a doc is important for new contributors, link it from this index and from the root `README.md`.
